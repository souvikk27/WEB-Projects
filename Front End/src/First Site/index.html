	<p>I am a B.Tech final year student preparing for my interview sessions also learning alongside the preparation.
		I was bit of confused from where to start and how to start and which technologies should i use to build my projects.
		Then i was introduced with Web Development and I found it really fascinating.
		So here I am learning from scratch building this basic website to showcase my knowledge.
		I'll keep improving this website as regularly as possible to keep up with the new things I've learned.</p>
