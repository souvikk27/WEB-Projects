    <h3><em>Music Production:</em></h3>
    <hr>
    <p>I used to produce music alot when I was persuing my diploma.
        I used to produce a genre called Trance music which was a sub-genre of EDM music.
        During that period of time I collaborated with many different artists from different countries
        accross the world.I will link my spotify account down incase you want to check my creations.
