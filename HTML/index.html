	<p>I am a B.Tech final year student preparing for my interview sessions also learning alongside the preparation. I was bit of confused from where to start and how to start and which technologies should i use to build my projects. Then i was introduced with Web Development and I found it really fascinating. So here I am learning from scratch building this basic website to showcase my knowledge. I'll keep improving this website as regularly as possible to keep up with the new things I've learned.</p>
